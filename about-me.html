        Hi, my name is Brenden Carvalho, 
        I am a graphic designer that takes a high interest in anything game related. 
        I love to spend my free time creating things that revolve around what I am currently playing 
        usually. I grew up playing sports my entire life and found a heavy interest in design once I 
        attended Umass Dartmouth. I love everything that graphic design has to offer and the 
        limitless possibilities that comes with graphic design. I am a determined and hard working person, 
        I like to complete my tasks to the best of my ability every single time and I guess that is the 
        competitive athlete in me!
